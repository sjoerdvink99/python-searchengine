# python-searchengine
A Python search-engine without the use of external libraries to calculate cosinus similarities between queries and documents. The code is primarily written in Dutch, but can be used for other languages. The most important thing is that the documents that you want to search through are in a .txt file. Flask is used for the GUI.
